Tip 1: Order Does Not Matter
When we multiply two numbers, it does not matter which is
first or second, the answer is always the same.

Example: 3×5=15, and 5×3=15
Another Example: 2×9=18, and 9×2=18

In fact half of the table is a mirror image of the other!
So, don't memorize both "3×5" and "5×3", just memorize that "a 3 and a 5 make 15" when multiplied.
This is very important! It nearly cuts the whole job in half.

In your mind you should think of 
3 and 5 "together" making 15.

So you should be thinking something like this:

3x5 thought

Tip 2: Learn the Tables in "Chunks"
It is too hard to put the whole table into your memory at once. So, learn it in "chunks" ...
A  Start by learning the 5 times table.
B  Then learn up to 9 times 5.
C  Is the same as B, except the questions are the other way around. Learn it too.
D  Lastly learn the "6×6 to 9×9" chunk
