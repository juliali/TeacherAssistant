History.

The oldest known multiplication tables were used by the Babylonians about 4000 years ago. However, they used a base of 60. 
The oldest known tables using a base of 10 are the Chinese decimal multiplication table on bamboo strips dating to about 305 BC, during China's Warring States period.
Many educators believe it is necessary to memorize the table up to 9 × 9. But the 12 x 12 is becoming popular in recent years.
